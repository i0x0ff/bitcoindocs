# Python

## Libraries

#### python-bitcointx

Python3 library providing an interface to Bitcoin data structures and protocol. It's a fork of Peter Todd's
`python-bitcoinlib`. It does not aim to be "The Swiss Army Knife of the Bitcoin protocol", but rather be a more
specialized tool for handling transactions and associated data, with a focus on correctness, consistency, and developer
ergonomics.

One key difference with it's parent fork is that bitcointx supports PSBT and Taproot.
