# Blocks

A block in the Bitcoin blockchain is like a page in a ledger or a record book. It contains a list of transactions that
have been verified and added to the blockchain.

Apart from transaction data, each block also contains a block header which consits of:

- **version**: version number
- **hash of previous block**: hash of the previous block header
- **merkle root**: merkle root of the transactions included in the block
- **timestamp**: epoch timestamp of the block
- **bits**: network target difficulty
- **nonce**: random value generated during the process of mining which must match certain criteria

At the time of writting Bitcoin had **807752** blocks. You can see the number increase by querying your Bitcoin node or use
[public Bitcoin explorer](https://mempool.space/blocks).
