# P2WSH

P2WSH stands for "Pay to Witness Script Hash". It's a native Segwit version of a P2SH which allows for more complex
conditions on how Bitcoins can be spent.

P2WSH is a more efficient approach for handling complex Bitcoin transactions compared to P2SH. It's an integral part of
the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade. In P2WSH transactions, the script's witness data — which includes things like
digital signatures and the actual script conditions — is segregated from the main transaction data. This separation
significantly reduces the size of the transaction, allowing more transactions to be included in a single block on the
Bitcoin blockchain. This not only improves the network's overall capacity but also addresses the transaction
malleability issue, enhancing the security and reliability of multi-signature and other complex transaction types.
