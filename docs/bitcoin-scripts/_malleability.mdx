Transaction malleability is an issue where it's possible for someone to make small modifications to a transaction that
don't affect its essence (i.e., sender, receiver, amount of Bitcoins transferred) but change the transaction's ID.
This could cause confusion and problems with the tracking and confirmation of transactions.
