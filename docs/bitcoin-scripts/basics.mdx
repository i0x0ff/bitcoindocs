# Basics

A Script serves as a set of instructions that accompany each transaction, known as the "locking script." This Script
dictates how the recipient can access the transferred Bitcoins. It's a stack-based language and is processed
from left to right.

To access the funds protected by the "locking script," an "unlocking script" is required. The transaction outputs become
unlocked and spendable only when the combined scripts (unlocking and locking) produce a valid result.

Locking script is more technically known as `scriptPubKey` and unlocking script is refered to as `witness` in SegWit
transaction and `scriptSig` in non-SegWit transactions.

:::note
Our focus will be primarily on SegWit transactions (P2WSH and P2WPKH) as non-SegWit transactions (P2SH and P2PKH) are
becoming less common and have a significant drawback â€“ malleability. This issue is particularly problematic in P2WSH
transactions.

Script language encompasses two primary components:

- **Data**: This could be a public key, a signature, a text blob, or any other form of information.
- **OPCODES**: These are basic constants, commands and functions used within the language.

<!--
Historically, OPCODES have been a subject of significant debate. Some OPCODES that were present in earlier iterations
have been deprecated due to their potential risks or harmful nature. New OPCODES are proposed on a regular basis, with
many currently under discussion.

You can find an excellent explanations and examples of the following on [learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script):

- How Scripts work?
- What makes a Script valid?
- Where can you find Scripts in Bitcoin?
- Why do we use Script?
- Examples of some standard Scripts

They nicely explain all of the above and we find it difficult to explain it better.


## Script Validation 

### Non-SegWit 

Non-SegWit transactions get validated by executing a Bitcoin script which is constructed by joining the `scriptPubKey`
and `scriptSig` fields, eg: `script = scriptSig + scriptPubKey`.


### SegWit 

In SegWit transactions, unlocking funds involves a two-step validation process. First, the transaction checks whether
the `scriptPubKey` matches the hash of the `witness_script`, confirming the use of the correct `witness_script`. If the
hash matches, the process then proceeds to execute and validate the Bitcoin script code within the witness. The
transaction successfully unlocks funds only if this script execution is validated successfully.

It's less crucial to focus on `scriptPubKey` validation if you can correctly construct and execute the Bitcoin script.

:::info
In non-SegWit transactions, the locking script is openly visible in the `scriptPubKey` field on the blockchain.
Conversely, in SegWit transactions, the locking script is not directly visible, as it is represented by a hash.
Therefore, when spending from a SegWit address, you must remember the `witness_script` that was used to lock the funds.

## How is Bitcoin script executed?

Execution of the Script happens on the stack, but before we execute it we need to construct the script.

Script is constructed by joining the `witness_data` and `witness_script`, with the `witness_data` coming first.

`witness_script` = <PublicKey /> <OpCode name="OP_CHECKSIG" /><br/>
`witness_data` = <Signature /><br/>
`script = witness_data + witness_script`<br/>
`script` = <Signature /> <PublicKey /> <OpCode name="OP_CHECKSIG" />

Above script is actually a script used for P2PKH (non-segwit). It's not really useful to use it in production.

## How to get the locking script aka. scriptPubKey?

Using `bitcoin-cli` you can look at the locking script by fetching a raw transaction and looking at the `vout` field.

This is how you can get a raw transaction.

```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction <transaction id> 2
```

In this example we only extract the `vout` field:

```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction c34798e099c08bd543cb09ff584d7e3aa890c0f077dc30726226805199d5f4c5 2 | jq '.vout'
[
  {
    "value": 0.00096761,
    "n": 0,
    "scriptPubKey": {
      "asm": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 1e55cbefb08c593f6cf3227ef00fea4c8415fad7 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",
      "desc": "addr(13mQ41XHghPKosyjwpHNPmWTPjSkQA3SKj)#wgq6gmvd",
      "hex": "76a9141e55cbefb08c593f6cf3227ef00fea4c8415fad788ac",
      "address": "13mQ41XHghPKosyjwpHNPmWTPjSkQA3SKj",
      "type": "pubkeyhash"
    }
  },
  {
    "value": 0.0098774,
    "n": 1,
    "scriptPubKey": {
      "asm": "0 ec6a3a46be774958cca64a39d456e8d99bb48c4f",
      "desc": "addr(bc1qa34r5347way43n9xfguag4hgmxdmfrz0juk2a7)#tnkprd53",
      "hex": "0014ec6a3a46be774958cca64a39d456e8d99bb48c4f",
      "address": "bc1qa34r5347way43n9xfguag4hgmxdmfrz0juk2a7",
      "type": "witness_v0_keyhash"
    }
  }
]
```

The script for the scriptPubKey (locking script) can be most human-readable by checking the `asm` field. You can also
see the `type` of the scriptPubKey that was used in case it was a standard one.

## How to construct an unlocking script?

The way you structure scriptSig depends on the scriptPubKey: you need to use the right key to unlock and spend the output
of a transaction.
