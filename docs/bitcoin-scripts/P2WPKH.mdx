# P2WPKH

P2WPKH stands for "Pay to Witness Public Key Hash". It's a native Segwit version of a P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash)
which securing Bitcoins to a hash of recipient's public key (address).

Compared to now mostly deprecated P2PKH, P2WPKH is more efficient and requires less data to be stored on the Bitcoin
blockchain. It's part of an upgrade called Segregated Witness (or SegWit). In P2WPKH transactions, the witness data
(like the digital signature) is separated (or 'segregated') from the main part of the transaction. This makes
transactions smaller in size, which means more transactions can fit into a single block on the blockchain, improving
the network's capacity as well as fixies a [malleability](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability) issue.
